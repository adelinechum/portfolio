			Adeline Chum is Assistant Director of the <a href="https://c4sr.columbia.edu/"> Center for Spatial Research</a> (CSR), Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP), where she leads multiple ongoing collaborative research projects ranging from mapping migration across African cities, the underfunding of poultry farms across the US, and the effects of liens and mortgages in the bail industry. She has also taught Advanced Design Studios as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at GSAPP. Prior to joining CSR, she has worked in architecture firms in Toronto, New York, and London. <br>

			In her current work, she is interested in exploring how data, spatial computational technologies, and their representation shape our understanding of land use productivity and critically examines sites of extraction and existing global infrastructures. She received her MArch from Columbia, GSAPP, where she has received the GSAPP Visualization Award, William Kinne Fellows Travelling Prize for her proposal, What it Takes to Grow Our Buildings: Consequences of Mass Timber Production on Forestry and Land Management in Sweden, and the 'Avery 6' Award.
